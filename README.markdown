Why go?
=======

Simplicity
----------

 - **Simple syntax**: Go's syntax is clean, well thought out, and simple to both parse and read. This simplicity of syntax means that go has builtin support for parsing go code, and has lead to the creation of tons of awesome tools.

 - **Simple features**: Go is designed to force code to be as simple as possible. This means there's no objects, no templates, no operator overloading-- all things which cause wtf bugs and useless abstractions in many other languages.

Tools
-----

 - **gofmt**: Single code formatting style, this tool's existence means deviations from coding standards are unlikely to occur often, and can easily be corrected when they do.

 - **gotest**: Single, unified, testing framework that is builtin to the standard go distribution. Makes writing unit tests easier than dealing with the small bugs in your initial implementation, and makes unit tests much more common.

 - **godoc**: Document your code with good comments, and get generated HTML or plain text documentation for free.

 - **gofix**: Major API change in the standard library? Just run gofix on your code to have function names and other small changes automatically rewritten.

 - **goinstall**: The simplest package manager a programmer could ever love. Goinstall supports installing local and remote packages, and automatically analyizes dependencies based on the source code. No additional package manager configuration files needed.
